# Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
# If n is even and greater than , print Not Weird
# Input Format

# A single line containing a positive integer, .

# Constraints
# 1<=n<=100
# Output Format

# Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

# Sample Input 0

# 3
# Sample Output 0

# Weird
# Explanation 0
# n=33
# nis odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird

#logic 2
